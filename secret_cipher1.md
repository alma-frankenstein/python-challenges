## Secret Cipher 1: Reverse Cipher

This exercise will give us practice reading and writing to files, as well as creative problem solving with Python. There are just a few simple steps:

1. There's a file in this directory called 'secret_message.txt'. Feel free to change what the message is!

1. Open and read 'secret_message.txt', and reverse its contents. 

1. Write the reversed contents to a new file.


There are a lot of ways to do this. Try to make each step its own function, and have the functions interact (i.e. use the return value of one function as the input value for another function. For instance, have your first function assign the contents of the secret message to a variable, then pass that variable as an argument to a function that reverses it).
